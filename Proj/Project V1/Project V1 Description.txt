E-commerce site: So far I am planning my e-commerce site to have 8 total pages. The first page is the Home Page. It will contain
a greeting as well as a hub to jump back to if needed. The home page leads to either a form to log-in or to the store listing pages.
Inside the store listing pages will be products listed with prices. These products can be added to a shopping cart which will be accessed
through a log-in. From there, you may go to a check-out/pricing page to see the total. Most of the site will probably end up being accessable
from any other page to simplify the process of navigating the website. I haven't decided on a "product" just yet, however I'm more worried at this
point with the implementation.




Puzzle/Game site: My idea currently for my personal project is to create a point and click
adventure game. It would take place inside a house that you (the user) have inherited from
your late grandfather. Your goal in the website is to navigate its various rooms and discover
your grandfather's hidden treasure room. I imagine the rooms will be displayed through seperate
pages, and each page will have some sort of logic puzzle for the user to figure out.

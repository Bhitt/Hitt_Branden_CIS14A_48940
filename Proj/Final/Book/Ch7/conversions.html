/*
--- "A number equals a string!" is logged to the console, so 99 == "99"
--- JavaScript is smart enough to determine that 99 and “99” are the same for all practical purposes. But what exactly is going on behind the scenes to make this work?
--- It turns out the == operator takes the types of its operands (that is, the two things you’re comparing) into account when it does a comparison. You can break this down into two cases: If the two values have the same type, just compare them, and if the two values have different types, try to convert them into the same type and then compare them
--- conversion is only temporary, so that the comparison can happen
